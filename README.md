# Media Operations Platform

A showcase project for a modern multimedia platform focused on asset lifecycle management, asynchronous processing, operational visibility, and user-centric web workflows.

Built to demonstrate production-style engineering across frontend architecture, backend services, background processing, and clean system design.

---

## Project Goal

The main goal of Media Operations Platform is to provide a realistic foundation for a multimedia platform that can:

- manage uploaded media assets
- process media asynchronously
- expose operational states and job progress
- support search and discoverability
- prepare assets for publishing workflows
- offer a clean and user-centric web interface

This project is intentionally structured like a real product platform rather than a small demo application.

---

## Highlights

- Product-style platform architecture instead of a small demo app
- React + TypeScript frontend with routed application shell
- FastAPI backend with versioned API structure
- Planned asynchronous processing with Celery and Redis
- Planned PostgreSQL-based asset and job persistence
- Foundation for media upload, processing, monitoring, and publishing workflows

---

## Why This Project

This project is intentionally built as a realistic platform engineering showcase.

Instead of focusing on isolated CRUD screens, it demonstrates how a multimedia platform can be structured across frontend, backend, processing workflows, and operational concerns. The emphasis is on maintainability, modularity, and production-oriented design.

---

## Core Use Cases

The platform is planned around the following use cases:

- Upload media assets such as video or audio files
- Store and manage metadata for each asset
- Trigger processing workflows in the background
- Track processing jobs and operational states
- Display assets in a searchable management interface
- Prepare media for publishing and delivery workflows

---

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a service-oriented structure with a dedicated frontend, backend API, and background worker layer.

### Planned architecture components

- **Frontend**
  - React + TypeScript + Vite
  - routing, layout, dashboard, asset management pages

- **Backend API**
  - FastAPI
  - versioned REST API endpoints
  - business logic for assets, jobs, uploads, and health monitoring

- **Database**
  - PostgreSQL
  - persistent storage for assets, jobs, and metadata

- **Background Processing**
  - Celery + Redis
  - asynchronous processing for media workflows

- **Storage**
  - local storage in early development
  - later MinIO / S3-compatible object storage

- **Search**
  - planned OpenSearch integration for asset discovery and filtering

## Local Development

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`.


### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary alembic pydantic-settings celery redis python-multipart
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`.

Health endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`

### Infrastructure (PostgreSQL + Redis)

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

### Migrations

```bash
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\alembic.exe upgrade head
```

### Celery Worker (Windows)

```bash
cd backend
.\run_worker.ps1
```

### Celery Worker (macOS / Linux)

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
celery -A app.workers.celery_app:celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

### Seed Data (10 assets)

```bash
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\seed_cern_assets.py
```
